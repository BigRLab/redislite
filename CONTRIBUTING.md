# Reporting Problems

If you've found a bug in Redislite. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub 
account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull 
requests.

## Using the issue tracker (Reporting an Issues)

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](https://github.com/yahoo/redislite/issues),
[features requests](https://github.com/yahoo/redislite/issues) and submitting 
pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23redislite&uio=d4)).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
